# Meine-Bim.com - React Frontend

Meine-bim.com is a React App, showing a map of Vienna and all its public transport stations. It utilizes Leaflet and Open Street Maps, as well as a fake API mocking some data for the public transport info. For the latter, I wait to get API access.

App can be seen here: [Meine-Bim.com](https://meine-bim.com)
