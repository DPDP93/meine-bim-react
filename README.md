# Meine-Bim.com - Frontend

Meine-bim.com is a React app mimicking the Quando Monitor function. By clicking on a train symbol, requests are sent to the Wiener Linien (Vienna Public Transport) API to get real time departure data. It utilizes Leaflet and Open Street Maps. I still wait to get full access to the API, as I currently run into CORS issues. 

App can be seen here: [Meine-Bim.com](https://meine-bim.com)
